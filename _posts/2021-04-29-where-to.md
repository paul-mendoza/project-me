title: where to?
---
As part of my process for transitioning companies I've taken several short(ish) coffee meetings with coworkers. The topics are open for anything but they'll usually follow a similar sequence: pleasantries, catchup, then 'ok wtf why are you leaving?'. It's allowed for a lot reflection and refining of my thoughts around my decision.  
My more recent chats have revealed in clearer detail my ideals about my career. The higher-level thought which I think others can draw from is don't think about titles too much, know what role you want to fill and let titles take care of themselves; specifically with me, I want to be using as much of my people skills and creativity as possible as I feel their potential and my enjoyment when exercising them is greater than my technicals; I want to be solving problems for people that matter to me; I want to be involved in decisions on the direction of whatever it is we're producing; I'm still an engineer at heart and would like a career that allows me to stay one, whether it's within the role itself or offers time outside my career to practice that.  
I feel it's important to consistently reflect on where we're coming from, where we are now, and also refine our vision towards where we want to go.
