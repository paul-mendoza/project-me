The general concensus around job satisfaction is it boils down to some equation of people + project + pay. Different people will place different weighting on each, in addition to varying weights between people, these weights can also change over time. Personally I've always been heavy on people + project, and monetary pay much less important than work-life balance (considered a part of the "pay" term in the equation).

Over one year into the pandemic with offices being closed, the weighting on people have slowly reduced. Understandably so, despite all my efforts, I've just been interacting with people so much less. As I've accepted an offer at another company, I've been doing plenty of retrospecting over my decision; this fact, reduced priority on the *people* part, was probably a big part of that decision. The greater emphasis on project and pay (particularly monetary), along with some mild discontent over project direction (which I aim to help realign before I leave), coinciding with an opportunity falling to me at a company with many strongly shared values, culminated into a choice to move on and plug in some very different coefficients into the equation.
