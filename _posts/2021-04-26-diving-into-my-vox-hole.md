title: diving into my vox hole
---
I make an effort of staying somewhat cultured. I say somewhat as I feel it's more of a curiousity into getting to know people with different passions instead of having it myself. I enjoy knowing what makes them tick, what got them to where they are, physically and emotionally when it comes to their interests. I may not share the same joy they do, but if I can understand it's origin within the person, it can act as a lens I wear to see things differently.

This idea of uderstanding a person's passion instead of directly trying to share in it is probably a big part in why I enjoy the way I travel: do-as-the-locals-do. With this whole global pandemic lockdown, I've had a growing itch to meet new people with different perspectives and interests.

Certain channels on YouTube have become a decent temporary replacement. 'Great Big Story' and 'Vox' (particularly 'Vox: Borders') have been my go-to's. These short videos I find are well produced and help paint a picture or tell a story of how others live in different parts of the world. Still, it's only a part of what I crave, an amuse bouche before a closer real life connection. I actually want to experience and live it, albeit for a relatively brief moment. I'm already trying to decide where I'd want to go first once we're able.
