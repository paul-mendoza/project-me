At some point I started buying into the idea that a life can be divided into three parts: learning, earning, returning.

Doing the math, expected centenarian, turning 33 this year... not sure if it was meant to be an exact division into thirds but I do feel I'm in some kind of transition.

I don't feel I would or should ever stop seeking knowledge, developing mental models, grasping patterned concepts and such, it's just too baked into my dna, but there is a growing desire for a greater reward for my efforts and actions based off all that knowledge.

What can that look like? More money is the simple thought, but with money earned coming in as a rate, the 2nd part to the equation is time. More and more people are understanding that, i.e. "The 4 Day Work Week". I've been wondering which one I want more, and what can I do to influence it one way or another.
