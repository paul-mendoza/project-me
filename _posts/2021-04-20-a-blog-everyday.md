Developing a desired habit can be tough. I've read plenty of books, articles, posts and discussions on the topic, and a very common  theme arises: make the first step easy, and then take it.


When I visualize the type of person I want to be, a lot of what I see is surrounded by good habits. Eating healthy, exercise regularly, write or express myself regularly. That last one stands out to me as I haven't really seen much of that in myself ever. I think that's where this is coming from. So to follow my previous thought, lets reduce my first step towards the goal of writing/bloggin everyday down to 3 times a week. By the 27th. I should have 3 more posts after this one.
