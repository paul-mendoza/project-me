### About Me
I'm a software developer based in Vancouver BC, Canada. At my core I'm an engineer; code and software was just the medium I chose. I enjoy electronics, cars and mechanical things as well, in an alternate universe I'd find myself in one those fields. I'm fortunate to have my career and engineering mind align, so with my spare time I spend watching movies, play computer games (currently Apex, Valorant, waiting on DII: Resurrected), and playing sports (volleyball, softball, tennis are my go-to).

### About This Site
There's been a growing desire in me to share more about me; my knowledge, thoughts, ideas, spilled out from my head onto something, somewhere, where it can possibly consumed.
